# Lukas Schirren | Research Associate @ Imperial

My research interests span system modelling, optimisation, operations research, spatial analysis, and sensitivity analysis, especially targeting energy topics such as industrial decarbonisation (green hydrogen/ammonia) and hydropower. My current focus is on research in low- and middle-income countries.
