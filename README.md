# Lukas Schirren | Research Associate @ Imperial

My research interests span system modelling, optimisation, and operations research with a strong focus on real-world energy challenges. I plan to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to enhance energy system modelling, particularly in the context of uncertainty and risk, for example resilient infrastructure and capacity planning.

My current projects cover industrial decarbonisation (green hydrogen/ammonia), hydropower-based green hydrogen production in Laos and Nepal.


## Research Interests

- **Energy System Modelling & Optimization:**  
  Developing robust, adaptive models to simulate and optimise complex energy systems under uncertainty.

- **Decarbonisation Strategies:**  
  Investigating the role of renewable energy sources, including green hydrogen and hydropower, in achieving low-carbon energy systems, with applications in both high-risk and low- and low-income countries.

- **Machine Learning for Uncertainty & Risk Quantification:**  
  Creating and integrating ML modules—such as Bayesian neural networks, unsupervised anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning—into simulation loops to dynamically adjust model parameters in response to evolving risks (e.g., war-induced infrastructure damage).
