## Research Interests

- **Energy System Modelling & Optimisation:**  
  Advancing and applying power system models like PyPSA to diverse regions and use cases, to simulate and optimise complex energy systems under uncertainty.

- **Decarbonisation Strategies:**  
  Investigating the integration of renewables, hydropower, and green hydrogen to support low-carbon transitions, with attention to challenges in both high-risk and low-income settings.

- **Machine Learning for Uncertainty & Risk Quantification:**  
  Exploring ML applications for improving energy models, including estimating hydropower parameters from limited data and enhancing data preprocessing to support robust simulations and uncertainty analysis.
